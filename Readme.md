<center><h1>C Garbage Collector</h1></center>

- [x] A simple and portable C garbage collector for files and memory allocations

- [x] Works on any modern C compiler replacing default fopen(), fclose(), malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free() functions

- [x] Fast, very easy to use and modify under MIT license!

  C language doesn't have (and will never have) a garbage collector. Sometimes it's very hard (or the time is very short) to solve memory leaks, so here is your solution.

  Sockets has portability issues, but it could be implemented in the same way. Any trouble, contact me!
